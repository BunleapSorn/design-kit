            These studies explore real-world design and product limitations
            through the examination of a set of fictional apps, each designed
            with unique properties and use cases. Each study illustrates how
            multiple design decisions are made and how different brands express
            themselves across a variety of product categories, including retail,
            music, productivity, finance, on-demand services, and education.

            Material Design is guided by print design methods — typography,
            grids, space, scale, color, and imagery — to create hierarchy,
            meaning, and focus that immerse viewers in the experience.

            You can communicate an element’s change of state by using a
            different shape from the rest of the elements or surfaces in that
            group. When using shape to indicate a state change, use it
            consistently with that state, in every instance it occurs.
